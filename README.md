## Insights
- Our most successful category is "Beauty & Hygiene," closely followed by "Kitchen, Garden & Pets." These findings reveal a clear customer preference, and focusing on these categories will drive our business growth.
- The majority of our customers hail from the United States and India. Notably, the United States and India lead in terms of sales, underscoring their significant market potential.
- Our customer base primarily comprises adults and older individuals. This demographic alignment correlates with our top categories, which revolve around home and personal care.
- Upon analyzing the data, I identified a consistent trend: New customer additions peak at the beginning of the year but gradually decline as the year progresses.
- A substantial portion of our customers prefers online payments, with roughly 50% opting for credit card transactions.

## Recommendations
- Invest in improving product offerings within the top-selling categories of "Beauty and Hygiene" and "Kitchen, Garden & Pets" to cater to customer preferences effectively.
- Continuously gather customer feedback and reviews to understand their evolving needs and preferences. Tailor promotions and product offerings accordingly to maintain interest.
- While continuing to serve our strong customer base in the United States and India, explore strategies to expand our presence in other regions to ensure business diversification.
- Launch targeted marketing campaigns to attract and engage younger customers, introducing them to our product range and services.
- Develop and launch targeted promotional strategies during periods of declining customer additions. Offer special promotions, discounts, and bundled deals to entice both new and existing customers. Timely and compelling offers can rekindle interest in our products.
- To align with customer preferences and boost orders, I recommend activating “Pay Later.” This flexible payment option allows customers to place orders without immediate payment, enhancing their shopping experience and encouraging more orders.
